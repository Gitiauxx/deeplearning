    <div class="article__content"><p>This post collects notes on a neural network vulnerability known as adversarial
examples. Adversarial examples are inputs designed by 
perturbing an actual input so that the neural network
outputs a wrong answer with high confidence, although the perturbed 
input is not perceptually different from the original input.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-adversarial-examples">What are adversarial examples?</h2>
<p>Adversarial examples are inputs to a neural network that are maliciously crafted so that
the neural network misclassifies them with high confidence. A typical example is a neural network that categorizes images
by animal species. The left input is a a picture that is correctly classified as a panda; the right
input is the original image perturbed by the noise shown in the middle. Although there are no 
perceptual differences between the left and right images – they both look like pandas – the neural network
is very confident that the right input corresponds to the picture of a gibbon.</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/img/pandas.png" alt="Adversarial Example" /><em>Adversarial Example (source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">Goodfellow et al.</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>The lack of robustness to small perturbations is seen as a sign that 
neural networks do not learn the true data manifold. Moreover, an adversarial
attacker could use that weakness to generate visually undetectable 
input perturbations that lead to a misclassified output. Such attacks 
could have dramatic consequences when applied to a system with safety or security 
concerns. Think of how problematic it would be if an attacker could paint stop signs so that 
deep learning algorithms deployed in autonomous vehicles recognize them as
 yield signs.</p>

<h2 id="what-causes-this-vulnerability">What causes this vulnerability?</h2>
<p>Initially, non-linearities were thought to explain the lack of robustness to adversarial 
inputs. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">Goodfellow et al.</a> show that 
linear perturbations of non-linear models are 
sufficient to generate misclassification. Consider an image $\textbf{x}$ represented by an integer
pixel value between 0 and 255. Any perturbation within $1/255^{th}$  precision should not 
lead to different model output. Consider a perturbation $\eta$ within $1/255^{th}$ precision and the
resulting perturbed input $\overline{x}$.
The linear combination of the perturbed image with a weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ and $\overline{x}$, 
<script type="math/tex">w^{T}\overline{x} = w^{T}x + w^{T}\eta</script> is optimized by choosing $\eta=\epsilon sign(w)$. 
Therefore, a $\epsilon$ perturbation on each pixel of the image $\mathbf{x}$ leads to
a total perturbation of magnitude $\epsilon m n$ after the linear combination, where 
$m$ is the average value of the weight $\mathbf{w}$ across all dimensions and $n$ is the dimension
of $\mathbf{w}$. For high dimensional problems, the resulting perturbation can be large enough to
affect the final prediction of the model.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-generate-adversarial-examples">How to generate adversarial examples</h2>
<p>We have to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>White-box</em> models where the architecture and parameters values are available to the 
 adversary</li>
  <li><em>Black-box</em> models where the adversary does not access to the parameter values of the model, but can query
 the model for inputs of their choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fast-gradient-method">Fast Gradient Method</h3>
<p>The Fast Gradient Method (FGM) is a simple optimization procedure that has been shown to 
 have a high success rate at generating adversarial examples (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">Goodfellow et al.</a>). 
 Consider a white-box model with known parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$ and 
 loss function $\mathcal{L}(x, y, \mathbf{\theta})$. For a given clean input $x$
 and associated label $y$, the perturbation $\eta$ that maximizes 
 $\mathcal{L}(x + \eta, y, \mathbf{\theta})$ is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\eta = \epsilon sign(\nabla \mathcal{L}_{x}(x + \eta, y, \mathbf{\theta})),</script>

<p>where the gradients can be computed efficiently by backpropagation. The method is exact
for logistic classification and has high success rate for larger-non linear models.</p>

<h3 id="iterative-extension-of-fast-gradient-method">Iterative extension of Fast Gradient Method</h3>
<p>A natural extension of FGM is to proceed iteratively and apply the fast-gradient method to the adversarial
example generated at the previous iteration:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{x}_{adv, 0} = \mathbf{x}; \: \mathbf{x}_{adv, k} = Clip_{\epsilon}(\mathbf{x}_{adv, k-1} + \alpha sign(\nabla \mathcal{L}_{x}(\mathbf{x}_{adv, k-1},  y, \mathbf{\theta})))</script>

<h3 id="robustness-to-transformation-by-cameras">Robustness to transformation by cameras</h3>
<p>FGM is a simple and cheap method that has been shown to be very effective at generating adversarial examples.
It can be expanded to more realistic cases where generated examples will be seen by the classifier
only through a camera (that can potentially remove the perturbations introduced in the
adversarial example).  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02533.pdf">Kurakin et al.</a> show that neural networks are still vulnerable to perturbed inputs that
are seen by the neural network via a third party medium (e.g. camera, sensors).
They generate adversarial examples and pass them to the classifier through a cell phone camera.
Therefore, adversarially replacing real-world stop signs by their perturbed counterpart could force
an autonomous vehicle to misclassify those signs as yield signs.</p>

<h3 id="transferability-and-attack-on-black-box-models">Transferability and Attack on Black-Box Models</h3>
<p>White-box attacks are not very realistic, since vulnerabilities can be avoided by preventing
attackers’ access to the model’s parameters and architectures. However, 
it has been shown empirically that adversarial examples generalize to models
they were not trained against. That is, examples can be learned adversarially
against a child model and then used against its parent model if it is trained with a similar
dataset as the child model.</p>

<p>In practice, the attacker queries model A (parent) for n inputs $x_{i}$ and obtains model’s A
predictions $y$. The attacker trains a model B (child) to predict the queried $y_{i}$ from inputs 
$x_{i}$. Since the attacker knows the structure of model B, he can launch a white-box attack on
model B and obtained adversarial inputs $x_{i, adv}$ for any $i=1, …, n$. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02533.pdf">Kurakin et al.</a> show that 
these adversarial examples can be used against the original model A with a high success rate.</p>

<h2 id="a-bayesian-neural-network-perspective">A Bayesian Neural Network Perspective?</h2>

<h3 id="bayesian-neural-network">Bayesian Neural Network</h3>
<p>Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) are neural networks where the weights are assumed to be drawn from a prior distribution. Given a set of 
samples, we learn the posterior distribution of those weights.</p>

<p>This Bayesian representation of neural networks relates to Gaussian Processes. In the classification case, the binary output $y\in {0, 1}$ for an input $x$ is
modeled as a draw from a Bernouilly distribution with probability $\sigma((f(x))$, where $\sigma(.)$ is either the sigmoid or probit link; and 
$f(x)$ is a latent variable. Uncertainty about $f$ is modeled by assuming that $f$ is a Gaussian Process (see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/nickisch08a/nickisch08a.pdf">Nickisch and Rasmussen</a>). 
Given sample points $\mathcal{D}$, the objective is of Gaussian Process Classification is to estimate the posterior distribution
$p(f|\mathcal{D}$ and then the predictive distribution for an input $x^{*}$</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(y^{*}|\mathcal{D}, x^{*}) = \displaystyle\int\sigma(f(x^{*}))p(f|\mathcal{D})df.</script>

<p>Although the integral is intractable, the posterior distribution $p(f|\mathcal{D}$ can be approximated by variational methods. 
Because Gaussian Process can be modeled as a neural network with an infinite width, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gal16.pdf">Gal et Ghahramani</a>
shows that the predicted distribution can be approximated by simulating many forward passes over a neural network trained with Monte Carlo
dropouts.</p>

<h3 id="which-bnn-are-robust-to-adversarial-attacks">Which BNN are robust to adversarial attacks?</h3>
<p>Bayesian models are interesting in the context of adversarial examples, since they quantify how uncertain they are about 
their predictions. A natural question in the context of BNN is whether
adversarial examples are more likely to occur where the BNN is more uncertain 
about its predictions. The answer remains debated. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06552.pdf">Li et al</a> show that 
adversarial examples are more likely in low input density regions, but that they can still exist in high input density
regions. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08244">Rawat et al</a> show that across a large class of BNN, predictions for adversarial 
examples are more uncertain.</p>

<p>In this line of work
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00667.pdf">Lewis and Gal</a> connects the epistemic uncertainty of
a BNN and explore sufficient conditions 
for a BNN to be robust to adversarial examples. Consider an idealized Bayesian Neural Network that is a continuous model with high confidence on the training set.
It means that around each sample in the training set, there exists a small neighborhood around which 
the BNN has high confidence and is right about it. If the BNN has low confidence outside of those neighborhoods,
then there exists no adversarial example. The result seems almost tautological, but it has
an interesting implication for future research:
robustness to adversarial examples relates to how fast uncertainty increases as a BNN sees more 
misclassified examples and how slowly output probability decreases in the neighborhood of training samples.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Adversarial examples are currently an active area of research because they demonstrate potential vulnerabilities
of neural networks that could limit their deployment in applications where safety/security is a concern.</p>
